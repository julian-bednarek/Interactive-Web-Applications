* **PostgreSQL:** Relational database management system.
* **Auth0:** For identity and access management.

### Frontend
* **Angular:** Framework for building dynamic single-page applications.
* **TypeScript:** Superset of JavaScript for type safety and better developer experience.

* **Angular Material:** UI component library for a consistent and modern look and feel.
* **Auth0 Angular SDK:** For integrating Auth0 authentication in the Angular application.

## üìä Database Schema

The database is designed to support the various entities and relationships within a university's dean's office.

![Database Schema](p-src/schemas/db_schema.pdf)
*Source: `p-src/schemas/db_schema.pdf`*

Key entities include:
* `Person`, `Student`, `Teacher`, `Admin` (User hierarchy)
* `Auth0` (User authentication details)
* `Address`
* `Faculty`
* `FieldOfStudy`
* `Subject`
* `StudentToSubject` (Manages student enrollment in subjects and grades)
* `Fee`
* `Payment` (Tracks student fee payments)

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
* **Backend:**
    * Java JDK (version as per project requirements, likely 17+)
    * Maven
    * PostgreSQL server
* **Frontend:**
    * Node.js and npm (or yarn)
* **Auth0 Account:**
    * An Auth0 account with an Application and API configured.

### Backend Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-url>/p-src/src-backend
    ```
2.  **Configure `application.properties`:**
    Located in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
    Update the following properties with your local environment and Auth0 details:
    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=${DATABASE_URL} # e.g., jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/webdziekanat
    spring.datasource.username=${DATABASE_USER}
    spring.datasource.password=${DATABASE_PASSWORD}

    spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.audiences=${JWT_AUDIENCE} # Your Auth0 API Audience
    spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=${JWT_ISSUER} # e.g., [https://your-auth0-domain.auth0.com/](https://your-auth0-domain.auth0.com/)

    auth0.domain=${AUTH0_DOMAIN} # Your Auth0 Domain
    auth0.client-id=${AUTH0_CLIENT_ID} # Your Auth0 M2M Application Client ID (for Auth0Service sync)
    auth0.client-secret=${AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET} # Your Auth0 M2M Application Client Secret
    auth0.audience=${AUTH0_AUDIENCE} # Your Auth0 API Audience (same as above)
    ```
3.  **Build and Run:**
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    The backend server will typically start on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Frontend Setup
1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd <your-repository-url>/p-src/src-frontend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```
3.  **Configure Auth0:**
    Create an `auth0config.json` file in the root of the `p-src` directory (i.e., `p-src/auth0config.json`). This file is imported by `src-frontend/enviroments/enviroment.ts`.
    It should contain your Auth0 application details:
    ```json
    {
      "domain": "YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN",
      "clientId": "YOUR_AUTH0_FRONTEND_CLIENT_ID",
      "audience": "YOUR_AUTH0_API_AUDIENCE",
      "scope": "openid profile email read:everything write:everything read:student write:student read:teacher write:teacher"
    }
    ```
    *Ensure the `redirect_uri` in `src-frontend/app/app.config.ts` (e.g., `http://localhost:4200/login`) is registered in your Auth0 application settings under "Allowed Callback URLs".*
4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    ng serve
    ```
    The frontend application will typically be available at `http://localhost:4200/`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è API Endpoints

The backend exposes RESTful APIs under the `/api/` path:

* **`/api/admin/**`**: Endpoints for administrative tasks. Protected and requires admin permissions.
    * Example: `POST /api/admin/sync-users`, `GET /api/admin/get-students`, `POST /api/admin/add-subject/`
* **`/api/student/**`**: Endpoints for student-specific data and actions. Protected and requires student permissions (or admin).
    * Example: `GET /api/student/grades/{index}&{semester}`, `GET /api/student/personal-data/{index}`
* **`/api/teacher/**`**: Endpoints for teacher-specific data and actions. Protected and requires teacher permissions (or admin).
    * Example: `GET /api/teacher/subjects/{id}`, `PUT /api/teacher/grades/{id}/{subjectCode}&{index}`
* **`/api/public/**`**: Endpoints for publicly accessible data (e.g., list of faculties).
    * Example: `GET /api/public/faculty`

*(Refer to the `controllers` package in the backend source for detailed endpoint definitions.)*
